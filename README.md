Toolbar icon pack for foobar2000 (default UI)

![screenshot1.jpg](https://github.com/phurtive/fb2k_icons/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot1.jpg?raw=true)

This is a basic icon pack for foobar2000 (default UI) made with GIMP 2.8.22. Thought I'd share it in case any one else needed toolbar icons (since there are only a few included with foobar by deafault). This pack doesn't cover every single icon, but will cover a lot of the important ones. There are 18 icons.

The following icons are covered:


-Play  
-Pause  
-Stop  
-Stop after current  
-Previous  
-Next  
-Random  
-Reshuffle (2 types: standard shuffle arrows or dice)  
-Open containing folder  
-Properties  
-File / Open...  
-File / Open audio CD...  
-File / Preferences  
-Library / Rescan folders  
-View / Visualizations... (2 types: an eyeball and a droplet for MilkDrop)  
-View / Console

Mix and match as you please, of course.  

I might add more in the future.   

Enjoy!
