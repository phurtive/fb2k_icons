Toolbar icon pack for foobar2000 (default UI)

![screenshot1.jpg](https://github.com/phurtive/fb2k_icons/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot1.jpg?raw=true)

This is a basic icon pack for foobar2000 (default UI) made with GIMP 2.8.22. Thought I'd share it in case any one else needed toolbar icons (since there are only a few included with foobar by deafault). This pack doesn't cover every single icon, but will cover a lot of the important ones. There are 18 icons.

The following icons are covered:


-Play  
-Pause  
-Stop  
-Stop after current  
-Previous  
-Next  
-Random  
-Reshuffle (2 types: standard shuffle arrows or dice)  
-Open containing folder  
-Properties  
-File / Open...  
-File / Open audio CD...  
-File / Preferences  
-Library / Rescan folders  
-View / Visualizations... (2 types: an eyeball and a droplet for MilkDrop)  
-View / Console

Mix and match as you please, of course.  

I might add more in the future.   

Enjoy!

## How To Install
Instructions

You can save the icons to any location but I recommend putting them in the main foobar program files folder for convenience, in a subfolder called toolbar icons or something similar.
  
To apply them: 
1. Right click the toolbar area in foobar (the area with the icons)
2. Click 'Customize Buttons'
3. Click 'Change Icon'
4. Navigate to the icon you want to use for that particular button.
5. Press OK and that's it
